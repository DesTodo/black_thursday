## Black Thursday: ##

A business is only as smart as its data. This projects builds a system able to load, parse, search, and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerce business. It uses pure Ruby to build a custom ORM and to reproduce functionality provided by Active Record in Rails. The program emphasizes the implementation of: File I/O, relationships between objects, encapsulating responsibilities and data analytics.

SimpleCov is used, a code coverage analysis tool for Ruby, to gather code coverage data and the program is tested against a client provided spec harness to fulfill required functionality. Unit testing is built with the minitest/test framework for Ruby.
